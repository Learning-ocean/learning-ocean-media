# Amazon Route 53 Overview

## What is Route53

Domain names (including the names of domains, hosted zones, and records) consist of a series of labels separated by dots. Each label can be up to 63 bytes long. The total length of a domain name cannot exceed 255 bytes, including the dots. Amazon Route 53 supports any valid domain name.

- Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs.
- In AWS, the most common records are:

  - www.google.com => 12.34.56.78 == A record (IPv4)
  - www.google.com => 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 == AAAA IPv6
  - search.google.com => www.google.com == CNAME: hostname to hostname
  - example.com => AWS resource == Alias (ex: ELB, CloudFront, S3, RDS, etc…)

- A highly available, scalable, fully managed and Authoritative DNS
  - Authoritative = the customer (you) can update the DNS records
- Route 53 is also a Domain Registrar
- Ability to check the health of your resources
- The only AWS service which provides 100% availability SLA
- Why Route 53? 53 is a reference to the traditional DNS port

## What is a Domain?

- If you want to create a website or a web application, you start by registering the name of your website, known as a domain name. Your domain name is the name, such as example.com, that your users enter in a browser to display your website.

- In the digital world, a domain is like your home address on the internet. It's a human-readable name that corresponds to a unique numerical IP address. Just as your house has an address to locate it, websites use domains to be found on the internet.

- Definition: The name (e.g., example.com) entered in a web browser's address bar to access a website or web application.
- Importance: Essential for making a website or application accessible on the internet.

Domain Name System which translates the human friendly hostnames into the machine IP addresses

- www.google.com => 172.217.18.36
- DNS is the backbone of the Internet
- DNS uses hierarchical naming structure
  .com
  example.com
  api.example.com

## DNS Root: The Internet's Foundation

Imagine the DNS root as the foundation of a massive library. It's the starting point for all domain name resolutions. The DNS root contains information about the authoritative name servers for Top-Level Domains (TLDs). Think of it as the librarian who guides you to the right section of the library.

## Top-Level Domains:

TLDs are like the categories in our library. Common TLDs include .com, .org, .net, etc. Managing TLDs involves overseeing these categories. For instance, the organization ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) manages and regulates TLDs globally.

## Managing TLDs and Their Information:

Picture managing TLDs as overseeing different sections of the library. Each TLD has its own set of rules and regulations. Domain registrars, acting as librarians, interact with the TLDs to register, renew, or transfer domains. The TLDs maintain a record of authoritative name servers for the domains under them.

## NS Records and Updates:

NS (Name Server) records are like the index in our library. They point to the authoritative name servers for a domain. When you register a domain, you inform the domain registrar about your name servers. The TLD then updates its NS records to point to your name servers. It's akin to updating the library's index when a new section is added.

# Domain Registration Concepts Overview

## Domain Registrar

- Definition: A company accredited by ICANN to process domain registrations for specific TLDs.
- Role: Facilitates the registration process for users.
- Identify your registrar: [Finding your registrar](#)

## Domain Registry

- Definition: A company owning the right to sell domains with a specific TLD (e.g., VeriSign for .com).
- Responsibilities: Defines registration rules, maintains authoritative domain database.
- Key Information: Contact details, name servers for each domain are stored in the registry's database.

## Domain Reseller

- Definition: A company selling domain names on behalf of registrars (e.g., Amazon Route 53 for Amazon Registrar).
- Role: Acts as an intermediary for domain sales.

## Top-Level Domain (TLD)

- Definition: The last part of a domain name (e.g., .com, .org, .ninja).
- Types:
  - **Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs):**
    - Examples: .com, .org, .ninja.
    - Usage: Typically reflects the content or purpose of the website.
  - **Geographic Top-Level Domains (geoTLDs):**
    - Examples: Country codes like .us, .uk, or city codes like .nyc.
    - Specifics: Associated with geographic areas; some have residency requirements.

# How TLDs Update NS Records from Domain Registrars:

When you register a new domain or update your name servers, the domain registrar communicates with the respective TLD. The TLD then updates its NS records, ensuring that requests for your domain are directed to the correct name servers.

---

- You choose a domain name and confirm that it's available, meaning that no one else has registered the domain name that you want.
- You register the domain name with Route 53. When you register a domain, you provide names and contact information for the domain owner and other contacts.
- At the end of the registration process, we send your information to the registrar for the domain. The domain registrar is either Amazon Registrar, Inc. or our registrar associate, Gandi. To find out who the registrar is for your domain, see Finding your registrar.
- The registrar sends your information to the registry for the domain. A registry is a company that sells domain registrations for one or more top-level domains, such as .com.
- The registry stores the information about your domain in their own database and also stores some of the information in the public WHOIS database.
- The registrar sends your information to the registry for the domain. A registry is a company that sells domain registrations for one or more top-level domains, such as .com.

The registry stores the information about your domain in their own database and also stores some of the information in the public WHOIS database.

## How Amazon Route 53 routes traffic for your domain

When a user requests content for www.example.com after configuring Amazon Route 53, the following steps occur in a few milliseconds:

1. The user enters www.example.com in a web browser.
2. The request is sent to a DNS resolver managed by the user's ISP.
3. The DNS resolver forwards the request to a DNS root name server and then to a TLD name server for .com domains.
4. The TLD name server responds with the Route 53 name servers for example.com.
5. The DNS resolver caches the name servers for two days.
6. The resolver chooses a Route 53 name server and requests the IP address for www.example.com.
7. The Route 53 name server retrieves the IP address from the example.com hosted zone and returns it to the resolver.
8. The resolver returns the IP address to the web browser.
9. The web browser sends a request to the IP address (e.g., 192.0.2.44) where the content is hosted.
10. The web server at 192.0.2.44 returns the web page to the browser, displaying www.example.com.

# Amazon Route 53 Health Checks Overview

Amazon Route 53 health checks monitor the health of your resources, such as web servers and email servers. You can configure health checks to receive notifications when a resource becomes unavailable.

## Health Check Configuration

1. **Endpoint Details:**

   - IP address or domain name of the endpoint (e.g., a web server).
   - Protocol for the health check: HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP.
   - Request interval (how often Route 53 checks the endpoint).
   - Failure threshold (consecutive failures indicating an unhealthy endpoint).
   - Optionally, notification preferences for unhealthy endpoints.

2. **Health Check Process:**

   - Route 53 starts sending requests to the endpoint at the specified interval.

3. **Endpoint Status:**

   - If the endpoint responds, it's considered healthy, and no action is taken.

4. **Unresponsive Endpoint:**

   - If the endpoint fails to respond, Route 53 counts consecutive failures.
   - If failures reach the specified threshold, Route 53 marks the endpoint as unhealthy.

5. **Notification Setup:**

   - If configured for notification, Route 53 notifies CloudWatch.
   - CloudWatch triggers an alarm and uses Amazon SNS to notify specified recipients.

6. **Recovery Process:**

   - If the endpoint starts responding before the failure threshold is reached, Route 53 resets the count to 0.
   - CloudWatch doesn't notify if the endpoint recovers before the threshold is reached.

7. **Monitoring Only:**
   - Even without notification configuration, you can check health check status in the Route 53 console.

This system allows you to proactively monitor the health of your resources and receive timely notifications in case of issues, helping you maintain the reliability of your services.

## Route 53 Routing Policie

- Simple Routing policy
- weighted routing policy
- latency routing policy
- failover routing policy

## DNS Terminologies

- Domain Registrar: Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy, …
- DNS Records: A, AAAA, CNAME, NS, …
- Zone File: contains DNS records
- Name Server: resolves DNS queries (Authoritative or Non-Authoritative)
- Top Level Domain (TLD): .com, .us, .in, .gov, .org, …
- Second Level Domain (SLD): amazon.com, google.com,

## Route 53 – Records

- How you want to route traffic for a domain
- Each record contains:
  - **Domain/subdomain Name** – e.g., example.com
  - **Record Type** – e.g., A or AAAA
  - **Value** – e.g., 12.34.56.78
  - **Routing Policy** – how Route 53 responds to queries
  - **TTL** – amount of time the record cached at DNS Resolvers
- Route 53 supports the following DNS record types:
- (must know) A / AAAA / CNAME / NS
- (advanced) CAA / DS / MX / NAPTR / PTR / SOA / TXT / SPF / SRV

## Route 53 – Record Types

- A – maps a hostname to IPv4
- AAAA – maps a hostname to IPv6
- CNAME – maps a hostname to another hostname
  - The target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record
  - Can’t create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex)
  - Example: you can’t create for example.com, but you can create for www.example.com
- NS – Name Servers for the Hosted Zone
  - Control how traffic is routed for a domain

## Route 53 – Hosted Zones

- A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains
- Public Hosted Zones – contains records that specify how to route traffic on the Internet (public domain names)
  - application1.mypublicdomain.com
- Private Hosted Zones – contain records that specify how you route traffic within one or more VPCs (private domain names)
  application1.company.internal
- You pay $0.50 per month per hosted zone

## Route 53 – Public vs. Private Hosted Zones

## Route 53 – Records TTL (Time To Live)

### High TTL – e.g., 24 hr

- Less traffic on Route 53
- Possibly outdated records

### Low TTL – e.g., 60 sec.

- More traffic on Route 53 ($$)
- Records are outdated for less time
- Easy to change records

**Except for Alias records, TTL is mandatory for each DNS record**

## CNAME vs Alias

- AWS Resources (Load Balancer, CloudFront...) expose an AWS hostname:

  - lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com and you want myapp.mydomain.com

- CNAME:
  - Points a hostname to any other hostname. (app.mydomain.com => blabla.anything.com)
  - ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka. something.mydomain.com)
- Alias:
  - Points a hostname to an AWS Resource (app.mydomain.com => blabla.amazonaws.com)
  - Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN (aka mydomain.com)
  - Free of charge
  - Native health check

## Route 53 – Alias Records

- Maps a hostname to an AWS resource
- An extension to DNS functionality
- Automatically recognizes changes in the resource’s IP addresses
- Unlike CNAME, it can be used for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex), e.g.: example.com
- Alias Record is always of type A/AAAA for
  AWS resources (IPv4 / IPv6)
- You can’t set the TTL

## Route 53 – Alias Records Targets

- Elastic Load Balancers
- CloudFront Distributions
- API Gateway
- Elastic Beanstalk environments
- S3 Websites
- VPC Interface Endpoints
- Global Accelerator accelerator
- Route 53 record in the same hosted zone

**You cannot set an ALIAS record for an EC2 DNS name**

## Route 53 - Routing Policies

Define how Route 53 responds to DNS queries

- Don’t get confused by the word “Routing”
- It’s not the same as Load balancer routing which routes the traffic
- DNS does not route any traffic, it only responds to the DNS queries
- Route 53 Supports the following Routing Policies
  - Simple
  - Weighted
  - Failover
  - Latency based
  - Geolocation
  - Multi-Value Answer
  - Geoproximity (using Route 53 Traffic Flow feature)

## Routing Policies – Simple

- Typically, route traffic to a single resource
- Can specify multiple values in the same record
- If multiple values are returned, a random one is chosen by the client
- When Alias enabled, specify only one AWS resource
- Can’t be associated with Health Checks

## Routing Policies – Weighted

- Control the % of the requests that go to each
  specific resource
- Assign each record a relative weight:
- traffic(%) = (weight for a specific record / sum of all the weights for all records)
- Weights don’t need to sum up to 100
- DNS records must have the same name and type
- Can be associated with Health Checks
- Use cases: load balancing between regions, testing
  new application versions…
- Assign a weight of 0 to a record to stop
  sending traffic to a resource
- If all records have weight of 0, then all records
  will be returned equally

## Routing Policies – Latency -based

- Redirect to the resource that has the least latency close to us
- Super helpful when latency for users is a priority
- Latency is based on traffic between users and AWS Regions
- Germany users may be directed to the US (if that’s the lowest latency)
- Can be associated with Health Checks (has a failover capability)

## Route 53 – Health Checks

HTTP Health Checks are only for public resources

- Health Check => Automated DNS Failover:

  1. Health checks that monitor an endpoint (application, server, other AWS resource)
  2. Health checks that monitor other health checks (Calculated Health Checks)
  3. Health checks that monitor CloudWatch Alarms (full control !!) – e.g., throttles of DynamoDB, alarms on RDS, custom metrics,… (helpful for private resources)

- Health Checks are integrated with CW metrics

## Health Checks – Monitor an Endpoint

- About 15 global health checkers will check the endpoint health
  - Healthy/Unhealthy Threshold – 3 (default)
  - Interval – 30 sec (can set to 10 sec – higher cost)
  - Supported protocol: HTTP, HTTPS and TCP
  - If > 18% of health checkers report the endpoint is healthy, Route 53 considers it Healthy. Otherwise, it’s Unhealthy
  - Ability to choose which locations you want Route 53 to use
- Health Checks pass only when the endpoint responds with the 2xx and 3xx status codes
- Health Checks can be setup to pass / fail based on the text in the first 5120 bytes of the response
- Configure you router/firewall to allow incoming requests from Route 53 Health Checkers

## Route 53 – Calculated Health Checks

- Combine the results of multiple Health Checks into a single Health Check
- You can use OR, AND, or NOT
- Can monitor up to 256 Child Health Checks
- Specify how many of the health checks need to pass to make the parent pass
- Usage: perform maintenance to your website without causing all health checks to fail

## Health Checks – Private Hosted Zones

- Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC
- They can’t access private endpoints (private VPC or on-premises resource)
- You can create a CloudWatch Metric and associate a CloudWatch Alarm, then create a Health Check that checks the alarm itself

## Routing Policies – Failover (Active-Passive)

## Routing Policies – Geolocation

- Different from Latency-based!
- This routing is based on user location
- Specify location by Continent, Country or by US State (if there’s overlapping, most precise location selected)
- Should create a “Default” record (in case there’s no match on location)
- Use cases: website localization, restrict content distribution, load balancing, …
- Can be associated with Health Checks

## Routing Policies – Geoproximity

- Route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of users and resources
- Ability to shift more traffic to resources based on the defined bias
- To change the size of the geographic region, specify bias values:
  - To expand (1 to 99) – more traffic to the resource
  - To shrink (-1 to -99) – less traffic to the resource
- Resources can be:
  - AWS resources (specify AWS region)
  - Non-AWS resources (specify Latitude and Longitude)
- You must use Route 53 Traffic Flow to use this feature

## Route 53 –Traffic flow

- Simplify the process of creating and maintaining records in large and complex configurations
- Visual editor to manage complex routing decision trees
- Configurations can be saved as Traffic Flow
  - Can be applied to different Route 53 Hosted Zones (different domain names)
- Supports versioning

## Routing Policies – IP-based Routing

- Routing is based on clients’ IP addresses
- You provide a list of CIDRs for your clients and the corresponding endpoints/locations (user-IP-to-endpoint mappings)
- Use cases: Optimize performance, reduce network costs…
- Example: route end users from a particular ISP to a specific endpoint

## Routing Policies – Multi-Value

- Use when routing traffic to multiple resources
- Route 53 return multiple values/resources
- Can be associated with Health Checks (return only values for healthy resources)
- Up to 8 healthy records are returned for each Multi-Value query
- Multi-Value is not a substitute for having an ELB

## Domain Registar vs. DNS Service

- You buy or register your domain name with a Domain Registrar typically by paying annual charges (e.g., GoDaddy, Amazon Registrar Inc., …)
- The Domain Registrar usually provides you with a DNS service to manage your DNS records
- But you can use another DNS service to manage your DNS records
- Example: purchase the domain from GoDaddy and use Route 53 to manage your DNS records

## 3rd Party Registrar with Amazon Route 53

- If you buy your domain on a 3rd party registrar, you can still use Route 53 as the DNS Service provider

  1. Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53
  2. Update NS Records on 3rd party website to use Route 53 Name Servers

- Domain Registrar != DNS Service
- But every Domain Registrar usually comes with some DNS features

## Route 53 – Hybrid DNS

- By default, Route 53 Resolver automatically answers DNS queries for:
  - Local domain names for EC2 instances
  - Records in Private Hosted Zones
  - Records in public Name Servers
- Hybrid DNS – resolving DNS queries between VPC (Route 53 Resolver) and your networks (other DNS Resolvers)
- Networks can be:
  - VPC itself / Peered VPC
  - On-premises Network (connected through Direct Connect or AWS VPN)

## Route 53 – Resolver Endpoints

- Inbound Endpoint
  - DNS Resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Route 53 Resolver
  - Allows your DNS Resolvers to resolve domain names for AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances) and records in Route 53 Private Hosted Zones
- Outbound Endpoint
  - Route 53 Resolver conditionally forwards DNS queries to your DNS Resolvers
  - Use Resolver Rules to forward DNS queries to your DNS Resolvers
- Associated with one or more VPCs in the same AWS Region
- Create in two AZs for high availability
- Each Endpoint supports 10,000 queries per second per IP address

## Route 53 – Resolver Inbound Endpoints (prof)

## Route 53 – Resolver Outbound Endpoints(prof)

## Route 53 – Resolver Rules

- Control which DNS queries are forwarded to DNS Resolvers on your network
- Conditional Forwarding Rules (Forwarding Rules)
- Forward DNS queries for a specified domain and all its subdomains to target IP addresses
- System Rules
- Selectively overriding the behavior defined in Forwarding Rules (e.g., don’t forward DNS queries for a subdomain acme.example.com)
- Auto-defined System Rules
- Defines how DNS queries for selected domains are resolved (e.g., AWS internal domain names, Privated Hosted Zones)
- If multiple rules matched, Route 53 Resolver chooses the most specific match
- Resolver Rules can be shared across accounts using AWS RAM
- Manage them centrally in one account
- Send DNS queries from multiple VPC to the target IP defined in the rule
